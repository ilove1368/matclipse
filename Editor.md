Matclipse includes an editor for .m-files. It includes syntax highlighting, code formatting and error indicators in combination with the console.


## Developer information ##

The editor was written a while ago and the behaviour is not always optimal. The syntax highlighting part with regular expressions has to be overworked or replaced.
